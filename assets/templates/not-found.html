        <p>
            The page you tried to access does not exist. 
            This could be the result of your entering an invalid URL or the result of an application bug.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you entered an invalid URL, the solution is simple: <em>don't do that!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            If the cause is an application error, then please resist the urge to curse, pout, or stomp your feet.
            While these actions might feel satisfying, they won't address the problem.
            Reporting the issue to the site's administrator, on the other hand, <em>might</em> actually help.
        </p>

        <p>Draw upon the wisdom of your years and do the right thing.</p>
